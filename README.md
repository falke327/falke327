# Hello and welcome to falcons nest.

I'm a Developer from Germany, using Github to share my trainings and hobby works to you.

I studied Informatics in Darmstadt and finished in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science degree.

Since then I worked as a Software Developer until today. My main focus are Java and Groovy projects, but I also can look back on some experiences in Salesforce CRM and MS Dynamics 365 CRM development.

Now, in spring 2025, I have started working on a robot project. You can view the project status on my public project board. A lot is still in the planning stage. Later, I would like to have a vehicle with finished firmware that can also be programmed by my children using simple means.
